# Atelier Themes for VS Code

Atelier Schemes are ten colorschemes which by now are implemented in many applications using templates which can work with the Base16-Builder CLI tool<sup>1</sup>. For VS Code the dark - and light templates were created from scratch, making each theme come in a light â€“ and dark background variation. Time and effort was spend to make different markup and programming languages become more readable with these themes in Visual Studio Code.

### Installation

1.  Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
1.  Launch Visual Studio Code
1.  Choose **Extensions** from menu
1.  Search for `atelier-vscode-themes` by Atelierbram
1.  Click **Install** to install it
1.  Click **Reload** to reload the Code
1.  From the menu bar click: Code > Preferences > Color Theme > **Atelier_CaveDark** or any of the other themes (_use the arrow keys to preview_)

### Tweaks
Some additional tweaks can be made using the [VSCode Custom CSS extension](https://github.com/be5invis/vscode-custom-css). This requires to have a CSS file on your computer that will hold your custom CSS. And example of some small tweaks I made are in the repo: [atelier-vscode-custom-css.css](https://github.com/atelierbram/Atelier-VSCode-Themes/blob/master/atelier-vscode-custom-css.css), so one can tweak those as well. Small things like the background color for the Panel title (down at the page, when activated - above the statusbar), and monochrome icons ISO colored ones, to make those icons less distracting.

Once done, open your command palette and select: `enable custom CSS and JS`

Run the command `Reload Custom CSS and JS` and the Custom CSS should be taking effect.

**_Note: Reloading custom CSS and JS after every VSCode update is a must!_**
